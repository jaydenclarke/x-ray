    <h1>what is the X-ray?</h1>
     
    <p>
   Bone x-ray uses a very small dose of ionizing radiation to produce pictures of any bone in the body. It is commonly used to diagnose fractured bones or joint dislocation. Bone x-rays are the fastest and easiest way for your doctor to view and assess bone fractures, injuries and joint abnormalities.

This exam requires little to no special preparation. Tell your doctor and the technologist if there is any possibility you are pregnant. Leave jewelry at home and wear loose, comfortable clothing. You may be asked to wear a gown

      <h2>How does it work?</h2> 
      <p>X-rays are a form of radiation like light or radio waves. X-rays pass through most objects, including the body. Once it is carefully aimed at the part of the body being examined, an x-ray machine produces a small burst of radiation that passes through the body, recording an image on photographic film or a special detector.

Different parts of the body absorb the x-rays in varying degrees. Dense bone absorbs much of the radiation while soft tissue, such as muscle, fat and organs, allow more of the x-rays to pass through them. As a result, bones appear white on the x-ray, soft tissue shows up in shades of gray and air appears black.

Until recently, x-ray images were maintained on large film sheets (much like a large photographic negative). Today, most images are digital files that are stored electronically. These stored images are easily accessible and are frequently compared to current x-ray images for diagnosis and disease management.</p>
      <h3>When should you be going for an X-ray?</h3>
      <p>- diagnose fractured bones or joint dislocation.
- demonstrate proper alignment and stabilization of bony fragments following treatment of a fracture.
- guide orthopedic surgery, such as spine repair/fusion, joint replacement and fracture reductions.
- look for injury, infection, arthritis, abnormal bone growths and bony changes seen in metabolic conditions.
- assist in the detection and diagnosis of bone cancer.
- locate foreign objects in soft tissues around or in bones.

      <h4>What are the benefits and risks of an X-ray?</h4>
      <p>Benefits
- Bone x-rays are the fastest and easiest way for a physician to view and assess bone injuries, including fractures, and joint abnormalities, such as arthritis.
- X-ray equipment is relatively inexpensive and widely available in emergency rooms, physician offices, ambulatory care centers, nursing homes and other locations, making it convenient for both patients and physicians.
- Because x-ray imaging is fast and easy, it is particularly useful in emergency diagnosis and treatment.
- No radiation remains in a patient's body after an x-ray examination.
- X-rays usually have no side effects in the typical diagnostic range for this exam.
        Risks
- There is always a slight chance of cancer from excessive exposure to radiation. However, the benefit of an accurate diagnosis far outweighs the risk.
- The effective radiation dose for this procedure varies. See the Safety page for more information about radiation dose.
- Women should always inform their physician or x-ray technologist if there is any possibility that they are pregnant. See the Safety page for more information about pregnancy and x-rays.</p>
        <h5>Why is an X-ray performed?</h5>
        <p>Your doctor may order an X-ray to:

- examine an area where you’re experiencing pain or discomfort
- monitor the progression of a diagnosed disease, such as osteoporosis
- check how well a prescribed treatment is working
            
-Conditions that may call for an X-ray include:

- bone cancer
- breast tumors
- enlarged heart
- blocked blood vessels
- conditions affecting your lungs
- digestive problems
- fractures
- infections
- osteoporosis
- arthritis
- tooth decay
- needing to retrieve swallowed items</p>
        <h6>What happens after an X-ray?</h6>
        <p>After your X-ray images have been collected, you can change back into your regular clothes. Depending on your condition, your doctor may advise you to go about your normal activities or rest while you’re waiting for your results. Your results may be available on the same day as your procedure, or later.

Your doctor will review your X-rays and the report from the radiologist to determine how to proceed. Depending on your results, they may order additional tests to develop an accurate diagnosis. For example, they may order additional imaging scans, blood tests, or other diagnostic measures. They may also prescribe a course of treatment.

Ask your doctor for more information about your specific condition, diagnosis, and treatment options.</p>
        <h7>how should you prepare for an X-ray?</h7>
        <p>X-rays are standard procedures. In most cases, you won’t need to take special steps to prepare for them. Depending on the area that your doctor and radiologist are examining, you may want to wear loose, comfortable clothing that you can easily move around in. They may ask you to change into a hospital gown for the test. They may also ask you to remove any jewelry or other metallic items from your body before your X-ray is taken.

Always tell your doctor or radiologist if you have metal implants from prior surgeries. These implants can block X-rays from passing through your body and creating a clear image.

In some cases, you may need to take a contrast material or “contrast dye” before your X-ray. This is a substance that will help improve the quality of the images. It may contain iodine or barium compounds. Depending on the reason for the X-ray, the contrast dye may be given in different ways, including:

- via a liquid that you swallow
- injected into your body
- given to you as an enema before your test
If you’re having an X-ray to examine your gastrointestinal tract, your doctor may ask you to fast for a certain amount of time beforehand. You will need to avoid eating anything while you fast. You may also need to avoid or limit drinking certain liquids. In some cases, they may also ask you to take medications to clear out your bowels.</p>
        <h8>What are the side effects of an X-ray?</h8>
        <p>X-rays use small amounts of radiation to create images of your body. The level of radiation exposure is considered safe for most adults, but not for a developing baby. If you’re pregnant or believe you could be pregnant, tell your doctor before you have an X-ray. They may suggest a different imaging method, such as an MRI.

If you’re having an X-ray done to help diagnose or manage a painful condition, such as a broken bone, you may experience pain or discomfort during the test. You will need to hold your body in certain positions while the images are being taken. This may cause you pain or discomfort. Your doctor may recommend taking pain medicine beforehand.

If you ingest a contrast material before your X-ray, it may cause side effects. These include:

- hives
- itching
- nausea
- lightheadedness
- 
            a metallic taste in your mouth
In very rare cases, the dye can cause a severe reaction, such as anaphylactic shock, very low blood pressure, or cardiac arrest. If you suspect you’re having a severe reaction, contact your doctor immediately.</p>
